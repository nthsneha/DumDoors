# AI Service Enhancement Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the enhancement of the existing AI service to provide response evaluation, scoring, and outcome generation capabilities. The enhanced service will evaluate player responses against curated scenarios, score them based on expected answers, and generate exaggerated outcomes that determine path difficulty.

## Glossary

- **AI_Service**: The FastAPI-based service that handles response evaluation, scoring, and outcome generation
- **Response_Evaluator**: Component that scores player responses against expected answers and reasoning
- **Outcome_Generator**: Subcomponent that creates dramatic good or bad outcomes based on scores
- **Path_Controller**: Component that determines path difficulty based on scoring performance
- **Score_Threshold_Poor**: Score range 0-30 indicating poor performance requiring longer path
- **Score_Threshold_Excellent**: Score range 70-100 indicating excellent performance allowing shorter path
- **Score_Threshold_Average**: Score range 31-69 indicating average performance with medium path
- **Curated_Scenarios**: Pre-defined set of 500 scenarios with expected answers and reasoning

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a game player, I want my responses to be evaluated against expected answers with clear reasoning, so that I understand how my solution compares to the optimal approach.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Response_Evaluator SHALL compare player responses against expected answers for each scenario
2. THE Response_Evaluator SHALL analyze the reasoning quality of player responses
3. THE Response_Evaluator SHALL provide detailed scoring based on how close the response is to the expected answer
4. THE Response_Evaluator SHALL include reasoning analysis in the evaluation process
5. THE Response_Evaluator SHALL complete evaluation within 5 seconds

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a game player, I want to receive dramatically exaggerated outcomes based on my response quality, so that the game feels more entertaining and provides clear feedback on my performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the total score is between 70-100, THE Outcome_Generator SHALL create an exaggerated positive outcome
2. WHEN the total score is between 0-30, THE Outcome_Generator SHALL create an exaggerated negative outcome  
3. WHEN the total score is between 31-69, THE Outcome_Generator SHALL create a moderate outcome reflecting average performance
4. THE Outcome_Generator SHALL ensure outcomes are dramatically entertaining while remaining appropriate for all audiences
5. THE Outcome_Generator SHALL create outcomes that logically connect to the original scenario and player response

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a game player, I want my performance to determine the difficulty of my path through the game, so that excellent performance is rewarded with faster progression and poor performance provides more practice opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the total score is between 70-100, THE Path_Controller SHALL recommend a shorter path with fewer scenarios
2. WHEN the total score is between 0-30, THE Path_Controller SHALL recommend a longer path with more scenarios
3. WHEN the total score is between 31-69, THE Path_Controller SHALL recommend a medium path with standard scenario count
4. THE Path_Controller SHALL respect the maximum and minimum node limits defined in environment configuration
5. THE Path_Controller SHALL provide clear path recommendations that can be used by the game engine

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want the AI service to work with curated scenarios and provide reliable evaluation capabilities, so that the game can operate smoothly with consistent scenario quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE AI_Service SHALL load and manage a curated set of 500 scenarios with expected answers and reasoning
2. THE AI_Service SHALL provide scenario retrieval capabilities without requiring AI generation
3. WHEN the primary AI provider fails, THE AI_Service SHALL automatically fallback to the backup provider for evaluation tasks
4. THE AI_Service SHALL log all evaluation requests for monitoring and debugging
5. THE AI_Service SHALL handle concurrent evaluation requests efficiently without performance degradation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure path difficulty parameters and monitor AI service performance, so that I can ensure optimal game balance and service delivery.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE AI_Service SHALL read maximum and minimum node configuration from environment variables
2. THE AI_Service SHALL track and report response evaluation metrics including scoring accuracy and processing times
3. THE AI_Service SHALL provide API endpoints for retrieving service performance statistics
4. THE AI_Service SHALL log detailed error information when evaluation failures occur
5. THE AI_Service SHALL support configuration of score thresholds and path parameters without service restart
