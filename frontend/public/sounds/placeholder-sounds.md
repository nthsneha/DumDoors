# Placeholder Sound Files

Since the actual sound files don't exist yet, the game will show console warnings but continue to work normally.

## To add real sound effects:

1. Create or find these sound files:
   - `bad_door.mp3` - A disappointed/negative sound (1-2 seconds)
   - `great_door.mp3` - A celebratory/positive sound (1-2 seconds)  
   - `okay.mp3` - A neutral/average sound (1-2 seconds)

2. Place them in this `/public/sounds/` directory

3. The game will automatically detect and use them

## Temporary Solution:

The sound effects system is fully implemented and will work as soon as you add the MP3 files. Until then:
- The game continues to work normally
- Console shows informative messages about missing files
- Sound effects button still toggles the system on/off
- No errors or crashes occur

## File Format Requirements:

- **Format**: MP3
- **Duration**: 1-3 seconds recommended
- **Quality**: 44.1kHz, 128kbps or higher
- **Volume**: Will be played at 50% volume automatically
