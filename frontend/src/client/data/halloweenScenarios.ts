  {
    scenario: "You're at a Halloween costume party dressed as a ghost, and you accidentally walk into a real s√©ance in the basement where everyone thinks you're the summoned spirit they've been trying to contact for an hour.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Start floating around making ghostly predictions about their futures and claiming you're their dead relative. You'll either traumatize someone or get punched when they realize you're fake. BEST decision: Immediately break character, apologize profusely, and explain you're just lost. Yeah it's awkward, but better than getting accused of mocking someone's dead grandma or getting involved in whatever weird spiritual drama is happening down there."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You're trick-or-treating and accidentally walk into someone's actual funeral reception thinking it's a haunted house. You compliment the \"realistic crying.\"",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Double down and ask where the candy station is while complimenting the \"commitment to the sad theme.\" You'll get physically removed and become the villain in someone's grief story forever. BEST decision: Realize your mistake within 2 seconds, whisper a mortified apology, and silently back out of there like you're defusing a bomb. Leave your dignity at the door - it's already dead anyway."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your fake vampire fangs get stuck to your real teeth right before an important job interview and you have to lisp through \"team player\" and \"synergy.\"",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Try to rip them off in the parking lot and break your actual teeth, then show up bleeding from the mouth looking like you lost a bar fight. BEST decision: Call and reschedule claiming a \"dental emergency\" (technically true), then spend the next hour with warm water and dental floss gently working them off. Your pride hurts but your teeth are intact."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You carved a pumpkin that looks exactly like your neighbor's angry face and they're now convinced you're planning something sinister.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Lean into it and place the pumpkin directly facing their window with a candle. You'll get a restraining order or at least a very uncomfortable visit from cops. BEST decision: Immediately go over with the pumpkin, laugh it off as a \"hilarious coincidence,\" and offer to carve them a nice one as an apology. Maybe throw in some cookies. Smooth it over before it becomes a true crime podcast episode."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You're wearing a full-body inflatable dinosaur costume and get stuck in a revolving door. A crowd gathers. Someone starts a TikTok livestream.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Panic and thrash around making it worse while the costume deflates sadly. You'll go viral as \"Revolving Door Dinosaur Extinction Event.\" BEST decision: Stop moving immediately, stay calm, let security or staff help deflate and extract you systematically. Yes you're on camera, but \"calm dinosaur rescued from door\" is way less embarrassing than \"dinosaur has door-based meltdown.\""
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your \"sexy cat\" costume rips completely at the back while you're bending over to judge a children's costume contest. Parents shield their kids' eyes.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Try to keep judging while holding the rip together with one hand and pretending nothing happened. Everyone sees everything and you're now banned from school property. BEST decision: Immediately stand up, excuse yourself with \"costume malfunction,\" walk backwards out of there with dignity, and find literally anything to tie around your waist. The story spreads either way, but at least you handled it like an adult."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You accidentally used permanent black hair dye instead of temporary spray for your witch costume. Your wedding is tomorrow and you're supposed to be a blonde bride.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Try to bleach it out yourself at midnight and end up with fried green-orange hair that's falling out in clumps. Your wedding photos will haunt you forever. BEST decision: Call an emergency hair salon first thing in the morning, pay whatever they ask, and be honest about your stupidity. They've seen worse. Worst case, you're a brunette bride or you rock a chic updo with extensions."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You're dressed as a mummy and your bandages start unraveling on a crowded subway. By your stop, you're just standing there in your underwear holding a pile of toilet paper.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep trying to rewrap yourself with dirty subway floor toilet paper while people film. You're now \"Subway Mummy Guy\" and it's not a good look. BEST decision: Embrace the chaos, hold the toilet paper bundle like it's designer fashion, exit with confidence at your stop, and immediately call an Uber while hiding behind a trash can. Delete social media for 48 hours."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your elaborate zombie makeup is so realistic that a Karen calls 911, an ambulance arrives, and the paramedics are annoyed they can't bill you.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Get defensive and argue with the paramedics about your \"artistic talent\" while they're trying to clear the scene. You might get charged with misuse of emergency services. BEST decision: Apologize profusely, thank them for their service, explain it's Halloween makeup, and offer to wipe some off to prove you're fine. Take the L gracefully - they deal with real emergencies and you wasted their time."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You bought 20 bags of candy for trick-or-treaters but stress-ate it all by October 30th. Now 50 kids are at your door and you're handing out loose granola bars and coins.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Turn off all lights and hide in your bathroom like a coward while kids egg your house. Your neighbors will never forgive you and your car is now abstract art. BEST decision: Run to the nearest open store, buy literally anything candy-related even if it's overpriced, and put a \"back in 5 minutes!\" sign on your door. Yeah it's expensive, but cheaper than explaining egg damage to your landlord."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your fake blood stained your friend's white Italian leather couch. They're screaming about the $4,000 sofa while you're frantically Googling \"does corn syrup come out of suede?\"",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Panic-scrub it with whatever chemicals you find under their sink and make it worse, possibly ruining the entire couch. You're paying $4,000 either way now. BEST decision: Stop touching it immediately, offer to pay for professional leather cleaning right now, and actually follow through. It might cost $300 but that's better than small claims court and losing a friend."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You're wearing a masked Scream costume and your crush kisses you thinking you're their ex. You don't correct them for 30 seconds too long.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep making out and reveal yourself later. You've now committed emotional fraud and your crush will rightfully never speak to you again. BEST decision: Pull back immediately after 2 seconds of shock, take off the mask, and awkwardly explain. It's mortifying but at least you're not a creep. Laugh it off and maybe they'll find it endearing. Maybe."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your dog ate all the Halloween chocolate and you have to rush them to the emergency vet. The vet judgment is worse than the $800 bill.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Try to \"wait it out\" or induce vomiting yourself with random internet advice. Your dog could literally die and you'll never forgive yourself. BEST decision: Rush to the emergency vet immediately, admit your mistake, pay whatever it costs, and commit to never leaving chocolate accessible again. The vet's judgment lasts 10 minutes, your dog's life is forever."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You wore a realistic gorilla suit to work for Halloween and security tackled you in the parking lot. HR wants a \"chat.\"",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Threaten to sue for assault while still in the gorilla suit. You'll lose your job and the case because you literally looked like an intruder. BEST decision: Apologize to security, acknowledge you should have warned them, take full responsibility in the HR meeting, and maybe don't wear full-body costumes to work anymore. Keep your job, lose your pride."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your \"scary clown\" costume terrified a child so badly they wet themselves. The mom is threatening to sue and you're dressed as Pennywise trying to apologize.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Argue that \"it's just Halloween\" and the kid needs to toughen up. You'll definitely get sued and you deserve it. BEST decision: Immediately take off the mask/wig, profusely apologize, offer to pay for dry cleaning or replacement clothes, and remove yourself from the situation. Document your apology and cooperation. Most parents won't actually sue if you're genuinely remorseful and helpful."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You're at a costume party dressed as a pregnant nun when your actual Catholic aunt walks in with a priest friend. They're not amused.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Make jokes about it or defend your costume choice. You'll be uninvited from Christmas and possibly written out of the will. BEST decision: Immediately find a coat or blanket to cover up, sincerely apologize for any offense, and explain you didn't know they'd be there. Maybe leave early. Damage control is your only hope here."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You spirit-glued a fake beard on for your wizard costume and it won't come off. Your hot date is in 2 hours and you look like a discount Dumbledore.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Try to rip it off with force, tearing your skin off with it. You'll show up to your date bleeding and scabbed. Very sexy. BEST decision: Soak it with oil (coconut, olive, whatever), work it gently for 30 minutes, and if it's still there, reschedule the date with an honest \"had a costume mishap\" text. They'll appreciate honesty more than you showing up looking like you lost a fight with a weed whacker."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your white sheet ghost costume got caught in a car door and you've been running behind it for two blocks like a kite. Drivers are honking.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep running with it and trip into traffic. You'll become a real ghost. Problem solved? BEST decision: Stop immediately, unhook yourself from the car (hopefully it's your car), and salvage what's left of the costume. Walk the rest of the way like a normal person. The honking is embarrassing, roadkill is permanent."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You accidentally wore your inflatable T-Rex Halloween costume to a serious Zoom meeting. Your boss watched you flail around for 3 minutes before you realized.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Try to play it off like your camera is glitching or it's a \"filter.\" Everyone saw. You look insane and dishonest. BEST decision: Immediately acknowledge it, apologize, say you forgot to turn off your camera before changing, and laugh at yourself. Most bosses appreciate someone who can admit a mistake with humor. Just don't do it again."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You reached into your Halloween decoration box and grabbed what you thought were fake spiders. They're very real and now scattered throughout your house.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Scream and run out of your house leaving the door open. Now you have homeless spiders and possibly a burglary. BEST decision: Contain your panic, grab a cup and paper, and start the slow process of catching and releasing them outside. Or call a friend who isn't afraid. Or burn the house down (kidding). Pest control is also an option if there's an infestation."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You're dressed as a breathalyzer at a party and drunk people keep genuinely blowing into your face expecting results.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep letting them do it and eventually get sick from drunk breath germs and someone vomits on you. BEST decision: After the first two times, start deflecting with \"you're over the limit!\" and dodge away. Make it a joke but protect yourself from becoming a human petri dish. Maybe stand near a corner where you can't be approached from all sides."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your Halloween contact lenses are stuck in your eyes and you're completely blind stumbling through a haunted corn maze. You've punched two actors.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep stumbling around hoping they'll \"work themselves out\" while you assault more minimum-wage haunted house employees. BEST decision: Immediately stop moving, call out that you have a medical issue, get help exiting the maze, and go to urgent care or an eye doctor. Those contacts can scratch your corneas or cause serious damage. Your vision is worth more than finishing a corn maze."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You made edibles for your adult Halloween party but they got mixed up with the trick-or-treat bags. Soccer moms are calling.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Deny everything and hope it blows over. You could face serious legal consequences for drugging children. BEST decision: Immediately call every parent you can reach, tell them exactly what happened, advise them to check their kids' candy, offer to cover any medical costs, and lawyer up. This is serious and honesty is your only defense. Also maybe stop making edibles."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your elaborate monster face paint won't come off and your passport photo appointment is in 1 hour. The DMV lady is not understanding.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Show up looking like the Creature from the Black Lagoon and argue with DMV staff. Your passport will be rejected and you've wasted everyone's time. BEST decision: Reschedule immediately, go home, and spend the next 2 hours with makeup remover, oil, and patience. If it still won't come off, see a dermatologist. A delayed passport is better than looking like a wanted fugitive in your official ID."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You're wearing 3-foot stilts as part of your costume and realize you can't fit through any doorway. You're trapped in the front yard of the party.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Try to limbo through and fall, breaking the stilts, your ankle, and your dignity. BEST decision: Accept defeat, carefully sit down, remove the stilts, carry them inside like a normal person, and put them back on if there's room. Sometimes the best decision is admitting your costume has logistical flaws."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your fake pregnant belly costume springs a leak in a crowded elevator. People think your water broke and someone calls 911 while you're screaming \"IT'S JUST A COSTUME!\"",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Get angry at people for trying to help and refuse to show them it's fake. The ambulance still comes, you still get billed. BEST decision: Immediately rip open the costume to prove it's fake, apologize for the scare, and thank them for their concern. Yeah it's embarrassing but at least you're not paying for an ambulance. Exit at the next floor and take the stairs."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You accidentally sent your boss a thirst trap mirror selfie in your sexy devil costume meant for your situationship. It's been read. No response.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Send a series of panicked follow-up messages making it worse. You're just digging deeper. BEST decision: Send ONE professional message: \"That was meant for someone else, I sincerely apologize for the inappropriate message.\" Then never mention it again. Start looking for a new job just in case. And turn on that \"ask before sending\" feature."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You wore a tight onesie dinosaur costume and desperately need to poop but the back zipper is stuck. You're sweating and doing the dance.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Wait too long and have an accident in a dinosaur costume. You'll never emotionally recover and neither will the costume. BEST decision: Swallow your pride, find a friend or even a stranger, and get help with the zipper NOW. Embarrassment is temporary, pooping yourself at a party is forever (in people's memories). If no one can help, cut yourself out with scissors. The costume is $40, your dignity is priceless."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your \"couples costume\" partner ghosted you so you're the back half of a horse at the party. Alone. People keep trying to sit on you.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Stay in the costume all night getting increasingly bitter and letting drunk people ride you. You're not a carnival attraction. BEST decision: Take off the back half, rock just the horse legs as a statement piece, and tell everyone you're \"a horse divorce.\" Own it. Make it your origin story. You'll be the legend of the party."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You carved 47 pumpkins for Instagram content and they're all rotting on your porch simultaneously. The smell has neighbors filing complaints.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Ignore it until the HOA fines you or rats move in. You'll have a bigger problem than smell. BEST decision: Spend an entire day disposing of them properly - trash bags, gloves, maybe a mask. Compost if possible. Apologize to neighbors. Learn that 47 pumpkins was insane. Next year do 5 max. Content isn't worth a pest infestation."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your elaborate special effects makeup makes you look like an actual burn victim. Your Uber driver is crying and won't accept payment.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Stay in character or insist it's \"just makeup\" while they're having an emotional breakdown. BEST decision: Immediately show them it's makeup, wipe some off to prove it, apologize for the distress, and insist they keep the fare plus a big tip. Maybe take it off before getting in rideshares next time."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You're dressed as a Breathalyzer test result and a genuinely drunk person keeps blowing whiskey breath directly into your mouth trying to get their \"score.\"",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Let it keep happening and catch whatever plague they're carrying. BEST decision: After the first time, dodge and tell them they \"failed\" and need to \"retake the test tomorrow.\" Create physical distance. Stand behind furniture. Your immune system will thank you."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your fake severed hand prop fell out of your bag at TSA. You're in secondary screening explaining why you're traveling with a silicon hand.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Make jokes about body parts or act suspicious. You'll miss your flight and possibly get detained longer. BEST decision: Calmly explain it's a Halloween prop, offer to show them it's obviously fake, cooperate fully, and apologize for the confusion. TSA deals with weird stuff daily - be boring and compliant and you'll be through faster."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You wore a full medieval iron suit of armor and now you're stuck in it, sweating, and desperately need to pee. The Renaissance fair closed 2 hours ago.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Pee in the armor. It's metal. It won't absorb. You're just sitting in a puddle of your own creation. BEST decision: Call a friend, call the fair security, call 911 if you must, but get help removing the armor. Yes it's humiliating but not as humiliating as a UTI from holding it or sitting in your own urine like a medieval nightmare."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your Halloween party invite said \"costume mandatory\" but you're the only one in a full dragon suit at this black-tie corporate fundraiser. The CEO is staring.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Commit to the bit and pretend it's intentional. You'll never get promoted. BEST decision: Immediately acknowledge the mix-up with humor, apologize for the confusion, and either leave to change if possible or own it gracefully. Make a self-deprecating joke and move on. Sometimes humility saves careers."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You bought a creepy antique mirror at a thrift store for decoration. Things keep moving in the reflection that aren't there. You're 60% sure it's haunted.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep it because \"it's probably nothing\" and wake up to it standing over your bed. BEST decision: Return it to the thrift store, sell it online to a ghost hunter, or throw it out. You don't need that energy in your life. Haunted or not, if it's freaking you out, it's not worth $15. Your mental health matters."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your skeleton costume glows in the dark but you forgot when you went to pee during the movie theater's horror marathon. Everyone screamed.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Run out of the bathroom glowing, making it worse and getting banned from the theater. BEST decision: Turn the lights on immediately, call out \"sorry, it's just my costume!\" and laugh it off. Exit calmly. Most people will realize quickly and it'll become a funny story instead of a traumatic incident."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You're dressed as conjoined twins attached to your friend but they ditched you to hook up. You can't reach the zipper and you're stuck in their bedroom listening.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Stay there listening and make it infinitely more awkward for everyone involved. BEST decision: Immediately call out that you're stuck and need help with the zipper. Interrupt them NOW. It's awkward but necessary. Then cut yourself out with scissors if needed. Your friendship might not survive but at least you escaped."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your \"easy to remove\" Halloween temporary tattoos won't come off your face. Your conservative in-laws' dinner is in 3 hours and you have a pentagram on your forehead.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Show up and try to explain it's \"just for fun\" while you have a literal pentagram. They'll think you've joined a cult. BEST decision: Scrub with oil, makeup remover, rubbing alcohol - whatever it takes. If it won't come off, use heavy concealer or makeup to cover it. Worst case, reschedule claiming you're \"sick.\" Sometimes lying is kinder."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You accidentally used your rent money to buy an $800 elaborate Predator costume you'll wear once. Your landlord is calling.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Ignore the landlord and hope they forget. You'll get evicted and have a sick costume to wear on the streets. BEST decision: Answer the call, explain the situation honestly, ask for a few days extension, and immediately return or sell the costume. Sell it online at a loss if needed. Housing is more important than cosplay. Learn to budget."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your realistic werewolf costume triggered someone's severe dog phobia at the party. They had a panic attack and now you're being asked to leave while dressed as a wolf.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Argue that \"it's not even a real dog\" or refuse to leave. You're making someone's genuine mental health crisis about you. BEST decision: Immediately remove the mask/head, apologize sincerely, and leave without drama. You didn't know, but now you do, and how you handle it shows your character. Check on them later if appropriate."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You're wearing a giant box costume as a Rubik's Cube and got stuck sideways in the haunted house hallway. Fire marshal had to be called.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Panic and make it worse, possibly causing actual damage or injury. BEST decision: Stop moving, stay calm, let professionals help extract you, apologize for the disruption, and accept that you're now haunted house legend. Maybe choose a costume with better mobility next year."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your fake witch's prosthetic wart fell into your cocktail and you swallowed it. It's now lodged somewhere uncomfortable and you can feel it moving.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Panic and make yourself vomit in the middle of the party. BEST decision: Stay calm (it's non-toxic makeup), drink water, and let it pass naturally. If you genuinely can't breathe or it's causing real distress, go to urgent care immediately. Otherwise, this too shall pass. Literally."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You dressed as a very specific 2019 meme and nobody at the party is old enough to remember it. You keep explaining and making it worse.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep explaining in increasing detail while people's eyes glaze over. You look desperate and old. BEST decision: After the second person doesn't get it, pivot to \"I'm just a weird guy in a costume\" and move on. Accept that some references have expiration dates. Make friends based on current conversation, not past memes."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your fog machine set off the fire alarm during your apartment Halloween party. The entire building evacuated and the fire department is charging you $500.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Argue with the fire department or try to hide who's responsible. They know. Everyone knows. BEST decision: Pay the fine, apologize to neighbors and your building management, and never use a fog machine indoors again. Maybe bring cookies to your neighbors. You're gonna be \"fog machine guy\" for a while, might as well be \"fog machine guy who apologized.\""
  },
  {
    scenario: "You're wearing a costume with a 4-foot demon tail and you've knocked over 6 drinks, a cake, and clotheslined 2 children.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep the tail on and continue your path of destruction. You'll get banned and possibly sued. BEST decision: After the second incident, take off or secure the tail. Apologize and offer to pay for damages. Spatial awareness is not optional when you're 4 feet wider than normal. Learn from this."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your vampire cape got caught in the mall escalator. Security had to stop it. A crowd formed. Someone filmed it. You're a TikTok trending sound.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Try to rip the cape free and fall down the escalator. BEST decision: Stay still, let security handle it, laugh at yourself when it's over, and accept your viral fate with grace. Comment on the videos with humor. You can't stop it, but you can control the narrative. Lean in."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You accidentally wore your full furry suit costume on the hottest October day on record (87¬∞F). You've sweated through it and it smells like wet dog and regret.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep wearing it until you get heat stroke and collapse. You'll go viral but you'll also go to the hospital. BEST decision: Take it off immediately, find shade and water, cool down, and chalk this up to a learning experience. The costume can be washed. Heat stroke can be deadly. Check the weather forecast next year."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your LED light-up costume short-circuited and strobe lights are going off while you're stuck at a funeral. Everyone thinks you're disrespectful. The priest is glaring.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Try to fix it there or pretend nothing's happening. You look insane. BEST decision: Immediately leave the funeral as quickly and quietly as possible while apologizing under your breath. Deal with the costume outside. Send a sincere apology note to the family later. This is one of those stories you never tell anyone."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You're dressed as a functional porta-potty and drunk people keep asking where the \"real bathroom\" is and getting mad when you explain it's just you.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep explaining and arguing with drunk people about your costume concept. They don't care about your artistic vision. BEST decision: Start just pointing them to the actual bathroom immediately. Skip the explanation. Your costume is too realistic and you've learned that practicality beats creativity when alcohol is involved."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your fake blood capsules burst in your mouth during a romantic kiss with your crush. They're screaming and you're trying to explain through a mouthful of corn syrup.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Try to keep kissing to \"save the moment.\" You're just making it more traumatic. BEST decision: Pull back immediately, spit out the fake blood (apologize), explain what happened, show them the package of blood capsules, and laugh about it. If they have any sense of humor, it'll become a great story. If not, probably wasn't meant to be."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You wore 6-inch platform boots for your demon costume and sprained both ankles in the first 10 minutes. You're crawling around the party.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Try to walk it off and make the injury worse, possibly breaking something. BEST decision: Take off the boots immediately, ice your ankles, and accept that you're sitting down the rest of the night. Call someone to take you to urgent care if the pain is severe. Pride heals faster than torn ligaments."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your elaborate 3-foot-tall witch hat won't fit in your car and Uber drivers keep canceling. You're walking 2 miles dressed as a witch getting honked at.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep trying to make it work and walk in the street. You'll get hit by a car while dressed as a witch. Not how you want to go. BEST decision: Take off the hat, carry it, and put it back on when you arrive. Or call a friend with a bigger car. Or accept that some costume pieces aren't transportation-friendly and simplify."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You're allergic to latex but wore a full latex bodysuit anyway. You're swelling up like Violet Beauregarde and trying to act normal.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Stay in the costume because you \"look so good.\" You could go into anaphylactic shock and die. Fashion isn't worth death. BEST decision: Remove the costume IMMEDIATELY, take antihistamines if you have them, and go to the ER if you're having any breathing difficulties. Allergies are no joke. Your life matters more than any party."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your inflatable Sumo wrestler costume deflated during your prize-winning moment on stage. You just sadly crumpled in front of 200 people.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Try to reinflate it on stage or throw a tantrum. BEST decision: Own the deflation, make a joke about it, bow dramatically while crumpled, and exit with whatever dignity remains. The crowd will love the humor more than a perfect costume. Sometimes failure is more entertaining than success."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You wore a costume covered in mirrors as a \"disco ball\" and keep accidentally blinding people. Someone walked into a wall. Another spilled their drink.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep spinning and shining, causing more casualties. You're a walking hazard. BEST decision: After the first incident, position yourself in a corner with controlled lighting or remove the most reflective pieces. Apologize to the walking-into-wall person. Your costume shouldn't require injury waivers."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your fake pregnancy belly shifted 90 degrees and now it looks like you have a sideways tumor. Your date is concerned and Googling symptoms.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Let them continue to worry about your health while you secretly know it's a costume. That's psychological torture. BEST decision: Immediately explain it's a costume malfunction and show them. Laugh about it together. If they're relieved and find it funny, that's a good sign. If they're mad you let them worry, that's fair feedback."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You're dressed as a realistic potted plant and three different drunk people have tried to water you with their beers.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Stay still and let them continue watering you. You'll be sticky and smell like a frat house. BEST decision: After the first beer shower, start moving and talking. Break the illusion. Position yourself away from drunk people with drinks. Sometimes being too realistic backfires."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your elaborate costume requires a handler to help you navigate and they got drunk and abandoned you. You've been stuck in the corner for 45 minutes.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Try to navigate alone and break something expensive or hurt yourself. BEST decision: Swallow your pride and ask literally anyone sober to help you. Or call a friend to come get you. Or carefully remove whatever parts of the costume are making you immobile. A good costume shouldn't require a sober handler."

  {
    scenario: "You wore a \"sexy\" version of your boss's signature pantsuit and they showed up unexpectedly to the party. The eye contact is excruciating.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Pretend it's not based on them or make jokes about it. Dig that hole deeper. BEST decision: Immediately leave, change if possible, or cover up with a jacket. Monday morning, apologize privately if needed. What seemed funny in theory is now a HR incident waiting to happen. Learn boundaries."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your elaborate monster makeup melted off in the unexpected rain. You look like Sloth from The Goonies and your date is reconsidering everything.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Try to fix it with more makeup in the rain. You're just making abstract art on your face. BEST decision: Laugh about it, wipe it all off, and own the bare face. If your date can't handle you looking human after weather ruins your makeup, they're not the one. Anyone worth dating will find the chaos endearing."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You're wearing a costume that requires you to hold your arms up like a tree. They went numb an hour ago and just fell and knocked over the punch bowl.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Try to keep them up and cause more destruction. BEST decision: Lower your arms, apologize for the punch situation, help clean up, and accept that your tree is now a dead tree. Blood circulation is more important than costume accuracy."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your fake bulbous witch nose fell off mid-conversation into the CEO's drink at the office party. They drank it.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Say nothing and let them discover it themselves. They'll think you tried to poison them. BEST decision: Immediately tell them, apologize profusely, offer to get them a new drink, and be prepared for some awkwardness. Monday morning might be rough but at least you were honest."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You wore a hyper-specific 17th-century plague doctor costume and a history professor at the party keeps loudly correcting your \"historically inaccurate beak length.\"",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Argue with them about plague doctor beak measurements. You'll both look insane. BEST decision: Say \"you're absolutely right, I went for Hollywood version over historical accuracy\" and walk away. You can't win an argument with someone who wrote their thesis on plague doctors."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your costume won \"most creative\" but you've needed to pee for 40 minutes and can't figure out the mechanics without getting naked.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Wait too long and have an accident while winning. Your victory is now infamous. BEST decision: Hand your award to someone, find a private bathroom, accept that you need to get mostly naked to pee, and plan better next year. A trophy isn't worth a bladder infection."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You're dressed as \"Girl with a Pearl Earring\" and someone spilled an entire glass of red wine on you. You're now a modern art disaster.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Cry and make a scene. The wine is already spilled. BEST decision: Blot what you can, say \"I'm 'Girl with a Red Wine Stain' now,\" and own the new look. Take photos. Make it intentional. Sometimes the best art is accidental."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your inflatable unicorn costume got a puncture and you're slowly deflating during your speech at the office party. Your boss thinks you're drunk.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep giving the speech while collapsing. Everyone's filming. BEST decision: Acknowledge the deflation with humor (\"and that's why we need better quality control\"), finish your speech quickly, and exit gracefully. Turn a wardrobe malfunction into a memorable ending."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You wore zombie face paint that chemically stains skin and have a first date with your dream person tomorrow. You're gray-green and rotting.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Show up gray-green and try to explain. They'll think you're contagious or strange. BEST decision: Reschedule the date with honesty (\"I have a Halloween costume mishap I need to fix first\"), scrub with everything safe you can find, and if it doesn't work, see a dermatologist. Most people appreciate honesty and will find the story charming once you're normal-colored again."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your costume involves a wig that keeps slipping off at the worst moments - during photos, while talking to your crush, while eating soup.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep adjusting it every 30 seconds. Just take it off. BEST decision: After the third slip, either secure it with bobby pins properly or take it off and go wigless. Your own hair is better than a wig that won't cooperate."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You're dressed as a giant hot dog and drunk people keep pretending to eat you and it's gone from funny to borderline assault.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Let it continue until someone actually bites you or you snap and punch someone. Legal issues either way. BEST decision: After the second nibble attempt, remove the bun portion of the costume or position yourself away from drunk people. Set boundaries loudly: 'Please don't touch the hot dog.' Security can help if needed."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your fake tarantula eyelashes are so heavy you literally can't keep your eyes open. You've been walking around blind for 2 hours running into things.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep them on and walk into something sharp or fall down stairs. Fashion isn't worth an ER visit. BEST decision: Take them off immediately. Carry them as a prop if you want. Being able to see is non-negotiable for safety. Tape them to your purse if you need them for photos."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You wore a costume with built-in speakers playing spooky sounds that won't stop. It's been 4 hours. The battery won't die. You're losing your mind.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep wearing it until you have a genuine breakdown and everyone's concerned about your mental health. BEST decision: Cut the wires, remove the battery pack forcefully, or take off the entire costume. Silence is golden. Your sanity matters more than commitment to a bit."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your elaborate costume is falling apart piece by piece throughout the night. You started as a dragon, you're now just a guy in green boxers holding some foam.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Try to keep putting pieces back on. Just accept entropy. BEST decision: Embrace the transformation. Tell people you're 'a dragon who lost a fight' or 'dragon after tax season.' Make the deterioration part of the character arc. Own it."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You're wearing a mascot-style Scooby-Doo head and can't see anything. You've walked into 4 walls, 2 people, and a table of food.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep stumbling around causing property damage and injuries. You're a liability lawsuit waiting to happen. BEST decision: Take off the head and carry it. Vision is pretty important for navigation. You can put it on for photos. No costume is worth a concussion or paying for the shrimp platter you destroyed."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your costume looked amazing online but in person you look like if Spirit Halloween and a dumpster fire had a baby.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Wear it anyway and get increasingly defensive when people don't compliment it. BEST decision: Laugh at yourself, own the disaster, and commit to the bit. 'I'm abstract disappointment' is now your costume. Confidence can make even a bad costume entertaining."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You wore a couples costume with your partner but they're now aggressively flirting with someone else. You're the other half of a socket and plug. Alone.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Cause a scene or stay attached to them watching the flirting. BEST decision: Detach yourself, find another person in a couples costume who got ditched, and create a new pairing. Or go solo and tell people you're 'electrically independent now.' Use humor to cope."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your fake vampire teeth whistle every time you talk. Everyone keeps asking if you hear that sound too.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep them in and whistle through every conversation, slowly driving everyone insane. BEST decision: Remove them after the first few whistles. Keep them in your pocket for photos. Nobody wants to listen to a human dog whistle all night."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You're dressed as Bigfoot and someone at the party genuinely believes they've made first contact. They're crying and trying to document it.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Stay in character and let them believe. You could traumatize someone or end up on a conspiracy theory podcast. BEST decision: Break character immediately, show your human face, and gently explain it's a costume. Be kind - they're having a moment. Maybe don't post about it on social media."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your costume requires professional dry cleaning and you just realized after doing a fake blood slip-n-slide in it.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Try to wash it yourself and ruin it completely. BEST decision: Take it to a dry cleaner immediately, be honest about what happened, and pray they can salvage it. It'll be expensive but cheaper than replacing the costume. Learn to check care instructions before slip-n-slides."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You wore stiletto heels with your witch costume and they keep getting stuck in sidewalk grates. You've lost one. You're hopping.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep wearing the remaining heel and destroy your back alignment. BEST decision: Take off the other heel and go barefoot/sock-footed. Carry both shoes. Your spine will thank you. Pack flats next year."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your elaborate costume won't fit through the automatic car wash and you're stuck halfway through. Water is flooding your car. The attendant is laughing.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Try to drive forward or reverse and damage your car and the costume. BEST decision: Put the car in neutral, let the attendant help pull you through manually, accept the humiliation, and remove the costume before attempting car washes in the future. Your insurance doesn't cover 'costume-related car wash incidents.'"
  },
  {
    scenario: "You're wearing a costume with built-in fans that keep blowing your wig off at inappropriate moments. It's happened 7 times. People are staring.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep the fans on for the 'effect.' The effect is 'person whose wig keeps flying off.' BEST decision: Turn off the fans or secure the wig properly with multiple bobby pins and wig tape. Sometimes you have to choose between special effects and keeping your wig on."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your fake gaping wounds look so real that a surgeon at the party aggressively tried to stop your 'bleeding' and ripped your costume.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Get mad at someone who was genuinely trying to save your life. BEST decision: Thank them profusely for their concern, apologize for the realistic makeup, and maybe tone down the gore next time. Medical professionals are trained to help - can't fault them for that instinct."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You wore a costume covered in loose glitter. It's on your face, your food, your car, your cat, your soul. You'll find glitter in 2027.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Try to clean it all immediately. You can't. Glitter is eternal. BEST decision: Accept your fate as a glitter entity. Vacuum what you can, shower, and know that glitter is now part of your DNA. Never use loose glitter again. Learn from this sparkling mistake."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your costume requires 8 AA batteries that died during your dramatic entrance. You're frozen mid-pose like a sad robot.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Stay frozen and hope someone notices you need help. BEST decision: Break character, announce 'battery failure,' and either carry spare batteries next time or accept that your costume's best moment has passed. Make your exit and recharge."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You're dressed as a traffic cone for laughs and a construction worker genuinely used you to redirect traffic. You're stuck in the road.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Stay there out of commitment to the bit. You'll get hit by a car. BEST decision: Immediately move to the sidewalk and explain you're not a real cone. Maybe take off the cone portion. Being too realistic has consequences."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your costume seemed hilarious until someone explained why it's actually super offensive. You're already at the party. Everyone's staring.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Defend it or argue it's 'just a joke.' You'll make it worse. BEST decision: Immediately apologize, acknowledge your ignorance, and leave to change if possible. If you can't leave, remove any offensive elements and keep a low profile. Learn from this and do better."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You wore a costume with a 6-foot train that keeps tripping people. Three people have fallen. One is threatening to sue.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep wearing it and claim 'they should watch where they're going.' BEST decision: After the first person falls, pin up the train or remove it entirely. Apologize to everyone who tripped. Offer to pay for any torn clothing or injuries. Safety over style."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your fake handlebar mustache keeps falling into your drinks and floating there like a dead caterpillar. You've consumed it twice.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep fishing it out and reattaching it. It's now soggy and disgusting. BEST decision: After the second drink incident, pocket the mustache. It's done. Let it rest. You can't have a mustache and drink liquids - pick one."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You're wearing an elaborate Iron Throne costume that requires help to sit and everyone is busy. You've been standing for 3 hours.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Try to sit alone and break the costume or hurt yourself. BEST decision: Take off the throne portion and just be 'person who fought for the throne.' Or plant yourself in one spot early and stay there. Sometimes costumes are incompatible with mobility."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your costume looked modest online but in person it's completely see-through under certain lighting. The party has a blacklight.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Act like nothing's wrong while everyone can see everything. BEST decision: Find out quickly, borrow a jacket or shirt, or leave to change. Ask a trusted friend to check you in the lighting before you walk into more rooms. Always test costumes in different lights."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You wore a costume with massive angel wings that keep knocking drinks out of people's hands. You've caused $80 in damages so far.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep the wings on and continue your path of destruction. BEST decision: After the second drink casualty, remove the wings and lean them somewhere safe. Apologize and offer to replace drinks. Wings are beautiful but impractical in crowds."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your realistic axe-in-head makeup made someone faint at the party. The ambulance came. You had to explain to paramedics it's corn syrup.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Be annoyed at them for 'overreacting.' Someone fainted. Show compassion. BEST decision: Help the person who fainted, apologize to them and the paramedics, and tone down the gore. Maybe put a sign on yourself saying 'makeup.' Your realism is too good."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You're dressed as a specific celebrity who got cancelled 3 hours ago and you didn't know. People keep asking if you're making a statement.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Defend the celebrity or pretend you knew. BEST decision: Check your phone, realize what happened, explain you dressed before the news broke, and either change or own the unfortunate timing with humor. Sometimes timing is just bad luck."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your costume requires you to walk backwards like you're possessed. You've backed into a pool, a grill, and someone's grandmother.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep walking backwards. The grandmother is filing a police report. BEST decision: After the first collision, commit to forward walking only. The bit isn't worth the injuries and property damage. Grandma's hip can't take another hit."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You wore a costume with a built-in voice changer stuck on 'demon mode.' You can't turn it off. You sound like Satan ordering an Uber.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Try to have normal conversations in demon voice all night. BEST decision: Text instead of talking, find the off switch or battery pack, or remove the voice changer entirely. If you need to speak, make it part of the character. 'Sorry, I'm cursed' works."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your elaborate furry yeti costume is giving you legitimate heat stroke indoors. You're hallucinating and people think it's method acting.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Stay in it because you 'don't want to ruin the costume.' You could literally die from heat stroke. BEST decision: Take it off IMMEDIATELY, get somewhere cool, drink water, and recover. No costume is worth hospitalization. Your body is sending emergency signals - listen to them."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You're wearing a costume covered in fake flowers and real bees are attacking you. You're allergic. You're running and screaming.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Try to stay in character while covered in bees. Anaphylaxis doesn't care about your commitment. BEST decision: Rip off the flowers immediately, get away from the bees, take your EpiPen if you have one, and call 911 if you're having a reaction. Bee allergies are life-threatening. Drop the costume and save yourself."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your fake oozing boils and pus-filled sores are so realistic your date just said they 'need to use the bathroom' 30 minutes ago and never came back.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Look for them and try to explain. They're gone. Accept it. BEST decision: Check your phone for a 'sorry I had to leave' text, wipe off the grossest parts of the makeup, and maybe choose less disgusting makeup for dates. You can be too good at gore."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You wore a costume with a full-face mask that completely fogs up your glasses. You're essentially blind and have walked into 3 parked cars.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep wearing both and continue walking into things until you hit something that hits back. BEST decision: Choose glasses or mask, not both. Or get anti-fog spray. Or just take off the mask and carry it. Three parked cars is your warning - four might be a moving car."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your costume involves a prop sword that security confiscated at the door. Your entire costume is 'knight with sword.' You're just a guy in armor now.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Argue with security and get kicked out entirely. BEST decision: Accept the L, go in without the sword, tell people you 'lost your sword in battle,' and make it part of your backstory. Or go home and change. A knight without a sword is still a knight."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You're dressed as an inside joke between you and your partner. Everyone thinks you're just lazy and didn't try. You keep over-explaining.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Spend all night explaining the multi-layered reference to people who don't care. BEST decision: After two people don't get it, accept that inside jokes don't translate to costumes. Just say 'it's abstract' and move on. Save the explanation for people who actually ask."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your costume requires constant adjustment and every 5 minutes something shifts and you look like you're flashing people. You're not. But it looks bad.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep adjusting publicly and making it more awkward. BEST decision: After the third adjustment, find a bathroom, use safety pins or tape to secure everything properly, or change into something more reliable. A costume that flashes people every 5 minutes is a lawsuit waiting to happen."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You wore a jester costume covered in bells. You can't sneeze, cough, or move without jingling. Your date is getting a migraine.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep the bells on all night. Your date will leave and you'll have permanent hearing damage. BEST decision: After you notice your date wincing, excuse yourself and remove the bells. You can still be a jester without the auditory assault. Silence is golden."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your elaborate 4-foot-tall Statue of Liberty crown keeps hitting ceiling fans. You've been hit in the head 6 times.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Duck lower and hope for the best. You'll get a concussion eventually. BEST decision: Take off the crown, carry it, and only wear it for photos outside where there are no ceiling fans. Your brain needs protection more than your costume needs a crown."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You're wearing a porta-potty costume that looked funny online but bathroom trips take 20 minutes of complete undressing in a stall.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Not go to the bathroom and get a UTI. BEST decision: Accept that this costume has a fatal flaw, plan bathroom breaks strategically, or change into something more practical. Sometimes a costume idea doesn't survive contact with bodily functions."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your fake zombie scars are peeling off and landing in people's drinks and food. Someone almost ate one. They're gagging.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep them on and contaminate more food. BEST decision: Remove all the peeling bits immediately, apologize profusely, and maybe stay away from the food table. Offer to pay for replacement drinks/food. Your makeup is now a health hazard."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You wore an inflatable sumo costume to a party in a studio apartment. You're physically stuck between the couch and wall.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Struggle and break furniture or pop your costume. BEST decision: Deflate slightly to squeeze out, or call for help to move furniture. Accept that inflatable costumes need space. Next time check the venue dimensions before committing to inflation."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your costume involves 2-foot stilts and you calculated wrong. Every ceiling fan is your enemy. Your head hurts.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep the stilts on and get more head injuries. Concussions are cumulative. BEST decision: Take off the stilts immediately and ice your head. You can still be tall-character without stilts. Or crouch. Or leave. Brain cells don't regenerate well."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You're dressed as a mattress and everyone keeps lying on you for 'hilarious' photos. Your back is breaking. You're not laughing anymore.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Let it continue until you have serious back injuries. BEST decision: After the third person, start declining firmly. 'The mattress is closed for business.' Stand against a wall where people can't climb on you. You're not furniture."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your costume looked family-friendly until a child pointed out it looks like 'a big penis.' Now you see it. Everyone sees it. You can't unsee it.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Argue with the child's observation. Kids are honest. BEST decision: Leave immediately and change if possible. If you can't leave, remove the most phallic elements or cover them. Once someone says it, everyone will see it. Your innocent hot dog costume is now ruined forever."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You wore a full rubber wetsuit costume and can't stop sweating. You're leaving literal puddles everywhere like a slug trail.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Stay in it and risk dehydration and heat exhaustion. BEST decision: Take it off, hydrate heavily, and switch to a breathable costume or go home. The puddles are embarrassing but heat stroke is dangerous. Your body is crying for help through your pores."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your costume requires holding a specific T-pose to look right. Your arms have been up for 2 hours. You're cramping. You might cry.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep them up until your muscles give out and you injure yourself. BEST decision: Put your arms down and do shoulder rolls. The costume doesn't work? That's okay. Blood flow to your arms is more important than aesthetic accuracy. Take breaks."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You're wearing squeaky clown shoes and every single step makes noise. During the moment of silence at the party. Everyone's glaring.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Try to walk quieter but still squeak. It's somehow worse. BEST decision: Take off the shoes immediately and hold them, or don't move at all during the silence. After the moment, remove them entirely and go sock-footed. Sometimes silence is non-negotiable."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your face prosthetics are slowly falling off asymmetrically. One side looks amazing, the other looks like melted wax. You look like Two-Face.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep trying to press the melting side back on. BEST decision: Either remove both sides and call it a night, or lean into the Two-Face look and make it intentional. 'I'm Two-Face now' is a pivot, not a failure."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You wore an air horn costume that seemed funny but you've accidentally set it off 15 times. People are genuinely mad at you now.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep wearing it and setting it off. Someone's going to punch you. BEST decision: After the third accidental honk, disconnect the air horn mechanism or remove the costume entirely. The joke's done. Now you're just the annoying person. Read the room."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your elaborate monster costume is so terrifying that you made 6 children cry. Their parents are forming an angry mob. You're running.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Stay and try to convince the kids you're friendly. They're traumatized. BEST decision: Remove the mask/scary parts, apologize to parents, and leave the children's area. Maybe give the kids space to calm down. Your realistic costume was too realistic for tiny humans."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You're wearing a costume with dangling chains that keep getting caught on doorknobs, railings, and one small child who is now attached to you.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Drag the child along. That's kidnapping. BEST decision: Stop immediately, carefully unhook the child, apologize to their parents, and remove or secure the chains. You're a walking hazard. Chains as accessories only work if they're short and contained."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your costume is the main character from a show everyone hates. You didn't know. People keep booing you. You think it's part of a bit. It's not.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Lean into the character thinking you're being funny. They genuinely hate you. BEST decision: Check social media, realize what happened, and explain you didn't know or change costumes. Sometimes pop culture moves faster than Halloween preparation."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You wore a costume that requires a 5-minute explanation to understand. You've lost your voice from explaining 40 times. People still don't get it.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep hoarsely explaining to everyone who asks. BEST decision: Stop explaining. Say 'it's interpretive' or make up something simple. Save your voice. A costume that needs a TED talk to understand is not worth laryngitis."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your costume has a 'realistic rotting flesh' smell feature. It's too realistic. People think you actually smell. You're being avoided like plague.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Stay smelly and alone all night. BEST decision: Wash off the smell feature immediately or spray yourself with something pleasant. The smell gimmick failed. Now you just smell bad at a party. Prioritize human interaction over authenticity."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You're dressed as an optical illusion that only works from one angle. People keep walking around you confused saying 'I don't get it.'",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Get frustrated explaining the specific angle they need to view you from. BEST decision: Accept that optical illusion costumes are hit-or-miss. Take photos from the right angle for social media and call it a day. Live costume illusions don't translate well."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your costume involves a puppet that keeps drooping and looking dead. Children are crying. Adults are uncomfortable. You can't fix it.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep the dead puppet visible. BEST decision: Remove the puppet entirely or hide it. A droopy puppet is worse than no puppet. Sometimes costume pieces don't work as intended and need to be retired mid-party."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You wore a clever costume but three other people had the exact same idea. You're all standing together awkwardly like a glitch in the Matrix.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Get competitive about who wore it better. BEST decision: Embrace it! Take a group photo, bond over the coincidence, and make friends. Great minds think alike. This could be the start of a beautiful friendship or at least a funny story."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your elaborate 5-foot wingspan costume blocks everyone in photos. People are asking you to move. You're trending on Twitter as 'that guy.'",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Refuse to move because you 'got there first.' BEST decision: Be aware of your space, position yourself in back/corners for photos, or remove the wings temporarily. Going viral as 'photo ruiner guy' is not the fame you want."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You're wearing a realistic spider costume and you've triggered 4 people's arachnophobia. You've cleared 3 rooms. You're alone now.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep the spider head on and wonder why you're isolated. BEST decision: Remove the most spider-like elements, especially if the party is getting small. Triggering genuine phobias isn't funny. Apologize to anyone you scared and maybe go less realistic next time."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your costume involves a working water fountain feature that's leaking all over the floor. People are slipping. Someone's threatening to sue.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep it running. You're creating a slip hazard and potential lawsuit. BEST decision: Turn off the water immediately, help clean up, apologize, and check if anyone was injured. A working fountain is cool until someone breaks their tailbone on wet floor."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You wore a costume that looked cool but completely prevents you from using your phone. You've missed 47 texts and your mom thinks you're dead.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Stay committed to the costume while your mom calls hospitals. BEST decision: Either modify the costume to allow phone access or check your phone regularly by partially removing pieces. Your mom's sanity matters more than costume integrity."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your costume's 'surprise pop-out element' keeps accidentally triggering. You've scared your Uber driver, a cashier, and a small elderly woman.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep it active. You're going to give someone a heart attack. BEST decision: Disable the pop-out mechanism or secure it so it doesn't trigger randomly. Accidental jump scares are only funny once, maybe twice. Not 47 times."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You're dressed as a controversial historical figure and a history buff at the party keeps aggressively arguing with you about facts.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Engage in a screaming historical debate at a party. BEST decision: Say 'you're absolutely right, I'm historically inaccurate' and walk away. Don't debate drunk history buffs. You can't win and everyone else is uncomfortable."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your costume involves dry ice for effect but it ran out an hour ago. You're just a sad Viking standing in an empty cooler.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep carrying the empty cooler around. BEST decision: Ditch the cooler, pivot to 'Viking without special effects,' and accept that some costume elements are temporary. The character remains even without the fog."

  {
    scenario: "You wore a costume that seemed edgy but is actually just making everyone deeply uncomfortable. The host has hinted 3 times you should leave.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Stay and make everyone more uncomfortable. BEST decision: Take the hint, apologize, and leave. If three hints happened, you missed hints one and two. Read social cues better and maybe reconsider your definition of 'edgy.'"
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your elaborate costume requires a bathroom buddy to help with zippers and Velcro. Your friends are sick of it. You've been abandoned mid-pee.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep asking for help. They're done. BEST decision: Next bathroom trip, cut yourself out if needed, or simplify the costume to be manageable alone. A costume that requires constant assistance is a failed costume."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You're wearing a costume with deep pockets but they have holes. You've lost your keys, wallet, and phone somewhere in the last 3 hours.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep using the pockets. BEST decision: Stop immediately, retrace your steps, check the last 3 locations, and start calling your phone. Put remaining valuables somewhere secure without holes. Learn to check pockets before trusting them."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your costume prop weapon keeps getting confused for real. You've been reported to police twice. Cops are tired of explaining its fake.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep carrying it and get arrested the third time. BEST decision: Leave the prop at home or in your car. After two police interactions, take the hint. The prop makes your costume but it's not worth a criminal record."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You wore a costume that photographs horribly. Every pic makes you look demonic or like a cryptid. Your Instagram is ruined.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep posting them hoping one looks good. BEST decision: Embrace the cursed photos, make them a meme, or just skip posting this year. Not every costume is photogenic. Sometimes the memory is enough."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your costume's 'cool LED light feature' is actually a blinding strobe that's giving people headaches. You've been asked to leave 2 venues.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Insist the lights are 'part of the costume' and try a third venue. BEST decision: Turn off the lights permanently. After two venue rejections, the lights are the problem. Be a non-strobing version of your character. People's neurological health matters more than your LEDs."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You're dressed as an obscure 1970s reference and you've spent the whole night explaining it to blank stares and pity laughs.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep explaining in more detail. They don't care and never will. BEST decision: Stop explaining. When someone asks, just say 'it's vintage' and change the subject. Your costume is for you. Not everything needs to land with everyone."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your costume is shedding fake fur everywhere. It's on the food, in drinks, stuck to people. You're banned from your friend's apartment.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep shedding and act like it's not a big deal. BEST decision: Take off the costume immediately, help clean up what you can, apologize profusely, and offer to pay for professional cleaning. Bring a lint roller next time or choose non-shedding materials."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You wore a costume that seemed comfortable but the fabric is giving you a full-body rash. You're itching everywhere. You can't touch anything.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep wearing it and scratch yourself bloody. BEST decision: Take it off immediately, rinse off if possible, and take an antihistamine. Some people are allergic to costume materials. Better to know now than scratch yourself into an infection."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your elaborate costume is going viral online but for all the wrong reasons. You're a meme. It's not a good meme.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Try to control the narrative by posting more and making it worse. BEST decision: Either ignore it and let it die naturally, or lean into it with self-deprecating humor. Fighting the internet never works. Accept your meme status or wait for the next viral thing."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You're wearing a tandem costume that requires two people but your partner got food poisoning. You're half a centipede hobbling alone.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Try to wear both halves. You'll overheat and look insane. BEST decision: Just wear your half and explain your partner is sick. Make jokes about being 'a centipede going through a divorce.' Solo-half energy is better than trying to be both halves."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your costume involves a 'rotting pumpkin' scent spray. It's too strong. People are gagging. You've given three people headaches.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep spraying it because 'it's realistic.' BEST decision: Stop spraying immediately, go outside to air out, and maybe wash it off if possible. Scent is powerful - too much makes you a biological weapon. Less is more with smell effects."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You wore a costume that seemed weather-appropriate but it's 40¬∞F and you're in a bikini shivering violently trying to act fine.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Get hypothermia for the aesthetic. BEST decision: Borrow a jacket, buy something warm, or go home and change. You can't enjoy a party if you're literally freezing. Your body temperature matters more than costume accuracy."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your costume's special effects makeup transfers onto everyone you hug. You've accidentally 'infected' 12 people with zombie makeup.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep hugging people and spreading makeup like zombie plague. BEST decision: Stop physical contact, warn people your makeup transfers, and maybe wipe off the most transferrable parts. Set your powder better next year."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You're dressed as something currently trending but it got cancelled while you were at the party. You found out from someone's disgusted stare.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Defend it or pretend you did it ironically. BEST decision: Check your phone, realize what happened, and either change or explain you dressed before the news. Sometimes the internet moves faster than party prep. It's unfortunate timing, not a character flaw."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your costume involves prop weapons that airport security is now VERY interested in. You've missed your flight explaining its styrofoam.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Argue with TSA about their rules. You'll miss more flights and maybe get detained. BEST decision: Accept they need to confiscate it, cooperate fully, and ship prop weapons ahead next time or don't bring them to airports. TSA doesn't care about your costume integrity."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You wore a costume that seemed inclusive but accidentally offended 4 different groups for 4 different reasons. Twitter is coming for you.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Try to argue or explain your intentions. Intent doesn't erase impact. BEST decision: Post a genuine apology, acknowledge what you didn't understand, commit to learning, and take the L. Remove costume photos. Sometimes you mess up despite good intentions."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your elaborate costume is falling apart and leaving a trail like Hansel and Gretel. People are following your debris trail back to you.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Keep wearing it and leaving pieces everywhere. BEST decision: Collect the fallen pieces, throw them away, and either repair or simplify your costume. You're littering your costume across the venue. That's not a vibe, that's a cleanup job."
  },
  {
    scenario: "You're wearing a costume that seemed funny but hits way too close to home for someone at the party. They're crying. It's your fault.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Tell them to 'lighten up' or that 'it's just a costume.' BEST decision: Apologize immediately and sincerely, take responsibility, remove or cover the offensive parts, and give them space. Not everything is funny to everyone, and that's okay."
  },
  {
    scenario: "Your high-tech costume is malfunctioning and playing your browser history out loud. Everyone's hearing your 2 AM Google searches. You want to die.",
    reasoning: "WORST decision: Try to play it cool while it broadcasts your search for 'why does my cat stare at me' and 'am I dying or is it just anxiety.' BEST decision: Rip out the speakers, turn it off completely, or run to your car. Social death is happening. Minimize casualties. Smash the tech if needed. Your dignity is worth more than the costume's electronics."
