# Real-Time Progress Tracking Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of real-time progress tracking for the DumDoors game, fulfilling task 6.1 from the implementation plan.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Player Position Tracking with WebSocket Broadcasts

- **Real-time position updates**: Players' positions are tracked and broadcasted immediately when they submit responses
- **WebSocket events**: Multiple event types for different aspects of progress:
  - `player-progress-update`: Comprehensive player progress information
  - `player-position-update`: Position changes within the game path
  - `real-time-score-update`: Immediate score updates with player feedback
  - `leaderboard-update`: Updated rankings after each round

### 2. Score Calculation and Display System

- **Enhanced scoring metrics**: Tracks total score, average score, and individual response scores
- **Real-time score broadcasting**: Immediate feedback when players submit responses
- **Progress percentage calculation**: Shows completion percentage based on current position vs total doors
- **Performance statistics**: Tracks doors completed, response times, and player activity status

### 3. Real-Time Updates for All Players in Session

- **Session-wide progress updates**: All players receive updates about other players' progress
- **Active connection tracking**: Monitors which players are currently connected via WebSocket
- **Leaderboard updates**: Real-time ranking updates based on progress and performance
- **Connection status indicators**: Shows which players are active/inactive

## API Endpoints

### New Progress Tracking Endpoints

1. **GET /api/game/progress/:sessionId/realtime**
   - Returns enhanced real-time progress data
   - Includes active connection status for each player
   - Provides comprehensive session statistics

2. **POST /api/game/progress/:sessionId/broadcast**
   - Manually triggers progress update broadcast
   - Useful for testing and administrative purposes

### Enhanced Existing Endpoints

- **GET /api/game/progress/:sessionId**: Enhanced with real-time data
- **GET /api/game/leaderboard/:sessionId**: Improved sorting and metrics

## WebSocket Events

### Progress-Related Events

```json
{
  "type": "player-progress-update",
  "sessionId": "session-123",
  "playerId": "player-456",
  "data": {
    "playerId": "player-456",
    "username": "PlayerName",
    "currentPosition": 3,
    "totalDoors": 10,
    "progressPercent": 30.0,
    "totalScore": 225,
    "averageScore": 75.0,
    "doorsCompleted": 3,
    "newScore": 85
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-10-27T..."
}
```

```json
{
  "type": "real-time-score-update",
  "sessionId": "session-123",
  "playerId": "player-456",
  "data": {
    "playerId": "player-456",
    "username": "PlayerName",
    "newScore": 85,
    "totalScore": 225,
    "message": "PlayerName scored 85 points!"
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-10-27T..."
}
```

```json
{
  "type": "leaderboard-update",
  "sessionId": "session-123",
  "data": {
    "leaderboard": [
      {
        "playerId": "player-456",
        "username": "PlayerName",
        "currentPosition": 3,
        "totalDoors": 8,
        "totalScore": 225,
        "averageScore": 75.0,
        "doorsCompleted": 3,
        "isActive": true
      }
    ],
    "message": "Leaderboard updated"
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-10-27T..."
}
```

## Service Architecture

### ProgressService Interface

New methods added to support real-time tracking:

- `TrackPlayerResponse(ctx, sessionID, playerID, score)`: Tracks response and updates progress
- `BroadcastRealTimeScoreUpdate(ctx, sessionID, playerID, newScore, totalScore)`: Immediate score broadcast
- `GetRealTimeSessionStatus(ctx, sessionID)`: Enhanced session status with real-time data

### WebSocketManager Interface

New methods for enhanced broadcasting:

- `BroadcastLeaderboardUpdate(sessionID, leaderboard)`: Broadcasts updated rankings
- `BroadcastPlayerStatusUpdate(sessionID, playerProgress)`: Comprehensive player status updates

## Integration Points

### Game Service Integration

The game service now integrates with progress tracking at key points:

1. **Response Submission**: Triggers real-time progress updates
2. **Score Processing**: Broadcasts immediate score feedback
3. **Round Completion**: Updates leaderboard and session progress

### WebSocket Integration

Enhanced WebSocket handling for:

- Connection status tracking
- Real-time event broadcasting
- Player activity monitoring

## Performance Considerations

- **Efficient Broadcasting**: Uses goroutines for non-blocking WebSocket broadcasts
- **Caching**: Leverages Redis for frequently accessed progress data
- **Connection Management**: Tracks active connections to avoid unnecessary broadcasts
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when WebSocket connections fail

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite includes:

- Unit tests for progress calculation
- Real-time update broadcasting tests
- WebSocket integration tests
- Mock implementations for isolated testing

## Requirements Fulfilled

This implementation satisfies the following requirements from task 6.1:

✅ **Create player position tracking with WebSocket broadcasts**
- Real-time position updates via WebSocket events
- Comprehensive player progress tracking
- Active connection monitoring

✅ **Build score calculation and display system**
- Enhanced scoring metrics and calculations
- Real-time score display and feedback
- Performance statistics tracking

✅ **Add real-time updates for all players in session**
- Session-wide progress broadcasting
- Leaderboard updates after each round
- Player status and activity indicators

## Next Steps

This implementation provides the foundation for:

- Task 6.2: Winner detection and game completion
- Task 6.3: Global leaderboard functionality
- Enhanced frontend integration for real-time UI updates
